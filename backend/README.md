# To-Do List Web App

A straightforward web app to help users keep track of their tasks. This project allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), it offers a user-friendly way to manage your to-dos.

## Project Setup

1. **Create the Project Folder**:
   - Named it `my-todo-backend`.
   - Opened it in VS Code.

2. **Initialize the Project**:
   - Ran `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ran `npm install express mongoose dotenv` to install Express (for building the server), Mongoose (for MongoDB interactions), and dotenv (for managing environment variables).

4. **Create Files**:
   - Created `app.js` for your server code.
   - Created `.env` to store your environment variables (like the MongoDB connection string and port).

5. **Write Code**:
   - **`app.js`**: Defined the server logic and routes for your to-do list API.
   - **`.env`**: Contains your MongoDB connection string and port number.

6. **Run the Project**:
   - Started the server by running `node app.js` in the terminal.

7. **Test**:
   - Tested your API endpoints using tools like Postman or your browser to ensure everything is working correctly.
